---- Setup ----

Update application.js to load files needed in the proper order as we go

1 Setup index.html.erb file, ID main regions, setup app.js.coffee
	- define app in primary app.js.coffee file
	- App.addRegions
	- App.on "initiialize:after" Backbone.history.start()
	- call App
2 Start app in application index.html.erb, using a JS tag

---- Modules/Apps ----

NO BACKEND
1 Primary module_app.js.coffee file
	- this is basically a wrapper app that tells the Controller to call different actions
	- use the API object to define functions that call controller actions
2 Controller for restful subdirectory (show, list, etc)
	- be sure to separate functionality 
	-- ie do not manually implement getters in a function, define a separate getter
	- Setup controller to try to insert view into appropriate region, then move to views
3 Define req'ed Views
	- setup template

BACKEND
1 Create Rails model, DB table, controller (respond_to :json), and 
index.json.rabl

2 Create entities (model and collection)

3 Top-level *_app.js.coffee file
	- create router first
	- then addInitializer with proper controller

4 Create controller
	- setup request for data from server

5 setup handler in the entities file
